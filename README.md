# github-backup-to-aws
This project is an automated backup to store all the github repostories from an account to an AWS bucket. It's probably a good idea to do the [Terraform Tutorial first](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started). The architecture looks like this:
![architecture](diagrams/github-backup.png)

# Step 1 - DONE
* Install `venv` to use a virtual environment on this project, when developing locally, it's important to create an isolate environment for each project so you can properly constrain the project dependencies. Take a look at [this guide to setup venv](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-python-3-and-set-up-a-programming-environment-on-ubuntu-20-04-quickstart) and create a `venv` called `venv`.
* Always remember to activate this `venv` before developing your python code for this project.
* The `venv` folder should live at the root of this github project.


# Step 2.1 - DONE
* Create a local python script that fetches all the github repositories from a account (both private and public), zips it and upload locally. You will need to read the [github public rest api documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) to understand how to fetch this data from github.
* To access the GitHub via API you will need a personal token, this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) shows how to do it.


# Step 2.11 
* Remove your `main` function, it doesnt do anything, it doenst receive any input to do calculations.
* On your `get_metadata` function, you need to call the `filter_repository_by_owner` function. Note that, because of that, `get_metadata` must receive as input `owner_name`.
* Now your `download_repos` function also must receive `owner_name` as input.
* On your `download_repos` function, add the `owner_name` parameter
* Create a code line to receive the value of `owner_name` as environment variable. If no variable is found, set `owner_name` to None. You can do something like this `owner_name = os.environ.get('owner_name', None)`. You will need this to pass in to the `download_repos` function.
* Call the function `download_repos` at the end of the script instead of `main()`.

# Step 2.2
* Once `2.1` is done, refactor your code to write the `.zip` files into an aws s3 bucket using [boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html) instead of writing the files locally on your machine.

# Step 2.3
* Once `2.2` is Done, create a lambda function on AWS Console with that logic and test it to see if it works.

# Step 2.4
* Once `2.3` is Done, Create that lambda using Terraform. (Create the Lambda Role using Teraform too). Ask Terraform to read a Secret on Secrets manager and pass those values to the lambda as Environment Variables.

# Step 3 - DONE/NOT_NECESSARY
* Create a python package containin your lambda code, so you can distribute it easily to other python projectcs (This will be important when start creating our test suite). Read this about [setup.py](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-setup-py-in-python/) to build your package. Once you have it configure, just run `$ pip install -e .` on your virtual environment.



# Step 6 - DONE
* Create Terraform configuration to integrate this project to an AWS account. You will need to configure the following files:
  * `backend.tf`
  * `providers.tf`
* With those files configured, test locally if you cant perform a `$ terraform init` and `$ terraform plan` successfully. (you can deploy an anamazon S3 bucket to test if this is working via Terraform)


# Step 7 - DONE
* Create Github Actions to deploy our infrastructure automatically using [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/br/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).

# Step 8 - DONE
* Create a lambda function (python code + infrastructure) and deploy it with terraform through the CI/CD Pipeline using [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
* We should have three GitHub Actions in place for this project, which are equivalent to three `.yml` templates:
  * One `.yml` template that runs a `pytest` `on: pull_request` to branch `master`. 
  * One `.yml` template that runs a `terraform plan` `on: pull_request` to branch `master`. 
  * One `.yml` template that runs a `terraform apply` `on: push` to branch `master`. 

# Stretch Goal


1) Refactor your python functions int a class that implements the Factory Pattern. Take a look at this article about the Factory Pattern, might give you an insight: https://realpython.com/factory-method-python/

1.1) Rewrite all your tests to comply with the new class created on 1)
